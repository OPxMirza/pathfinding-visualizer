# 🧭 Pathfinding Visualizer

A web-based tool to visualize popular **pathfinding algorithms** such as **BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and A***.  
Built with **React + TailwindCSS**, it helps understand how these algorithms work step by step.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive **grid-based board**  
- Set **start** and **end** nodes by clicking  
- Place **walls/obstacles** with drag & drop  
- Visualize:
  - **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth First Search (DFS)**
  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
  - **A* Search Algorithm**
- Step-by-step animation of visited nodes  
- Shortest path highlight  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React.js** – frontend framework  
- **TailwindCSS** – styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – algorithm implementation

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OPxMirza/pathfinding-visualizer.git
   cd pathfinding-visualizer


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open in browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Click** on any cell to set **Start** (green) and **End** (red).
2. **Click & drag** to add walls (black).
3. Select an algorithm from the dropdown.
4. Hit **Visualize** → watch the algorithm explore and find the shortest path.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* Weighted nodes for advanced Dijkstra/A\*
* Maze generation (recursive division / random walls)
* Adjustable animation speed
* Mobile-friendly UI
